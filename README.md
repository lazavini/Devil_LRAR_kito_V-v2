Computational Thinking is the problem solving method based on picking a complex problem, understanding what the problem is and developing solutions in a way that a computer or human could solve it.
To aid in this task Augmented Reality will provide a more visual and interesting way of presenting problems to subjects that will solve puzzles presented as computational inputs to solve a problem. 
This work will be composed of a case study of Augmented Reality and their uses and practices as well as Computational Thinking puzzles used as a training and skill developing tool among students.
Based on the gathered data a proof of concept tool will be developed to study and create an engaging game to retain the subjects interest. 
We believe and engaging experience is the most important aspect of a game to keep an interesting approach of young individuals.
